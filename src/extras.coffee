  ###
  Converts a PHP format string to Java/.NET format string.
  A PHP format string can be used with .$format or .format.
  A Java/.NET format string can be used with .toString().
  The .parseExact function will only accept a Java/.NET format string

  Example
  <pre>
  var f1 = "%m/%d/%y"
  var f2 = Date.normalizeFormat(f1); // "MM/dd/yy"

  new Date().format(f1);    // "04/13/08"
  new Date().$format(f1);   // "04/13/08"
  new Date().toString(f2);  // "04/13/08"

  var date = Date.parseExact("04/13/08", f2); // Sun Apr 13 2008
  </pre>
  @param {String}   A PHP format string consisting of one or more format spcifiers.
  @return {String}  The PHP format converted to a Java/.NET format string.
  ###
  $D.normalizeFormat = (format) ->
    $f = []
    t = new Date().$format(format)
    $f.join ""


  ###
  Format a local Unix timestamp according to locale settings

  Example
  <pre>
  Date.strftime("%m/%d/%y", new Date());       // "04/13/08"
  Date.strftime("c", "2008-04-13T17:52:03Z");  // "04/13/08"
  </pre>
  @param {String}   A format string consisting of one or more format spcifiers [Optional].
  @param {Number}   The number representing the number of seconds that have elapsed since January 1, 1970 (local time).
  @return {String}  A string representation of the current Date object.
  ###
  $D.strftime = (format, time) ->
    new Date(time * 1000).$format format


  ###
  Parse any textual datetime description into a Unix timestamp.
  A Unix timestamp is the number of seconds that have elapsed since January 1, 1970 (midnight UTC/GMT).

  Example
  <pre>
  Date.strtotime("04/13/08");              // 1208044800
  Date.strtotime("1970-01-01T00:00:00Z");  // 0
  </pre>
  @param {String}   A format string consisting of one or more format spcifiers [Optional].
  @param {Object}   A string or date object.
  @return {String}  A string representation of the current Date object.
  ###
  $D.strtotime = (time) ->
    d = $D.parse(time)
    d.addMinutes d.getTimezoneOffset() * -1
    Math.round $D.UTC(d.getUTCFullYear(), d.getUTCMonth(), d.getUTCDate(), d.getUTCHours(), d.getUTCMinutes(), d.getUTCSeconds(), d.getUTCMilliseconds()) / 1000


  ###
  Converts the value of the current Date object to its equivalent string representation using a PHP/Unix style of date format specifiers.
